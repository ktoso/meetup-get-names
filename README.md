Meetup Get Names
================
Getting tired of extracting the same names of your **Meetup**s participants each time you want to do a raffle,
or print name cards using an external tool?

This tool is the solution - you paste in your meetup's url, get back a plaintext list of names (or more - check out the code)
and then you can simply start a raffle based on that.

Demo
====
All you need to do is:

```
$ sbt run
Meetup URL:  http://www.meetup.com/Krakow-Scala-User-Group/events/96668702/

# and you get:
```
