Meetup Get Names
================
Getting tired of extracting the samesnames of your **Meetup**s participants each time you want do do a raffle,
or print name cards using an external tool?

This tool is the solution - you paste in your meetup's url, get back a plaintext list of names (or more - check out the code)
and then you can simply start a raffle based on that.

Beerware - if you like the app, use it, and we someday meet - buy me a beer (or slice of pizza if beer is unavailable). ;-)
